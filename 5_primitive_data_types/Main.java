/* The 8 Primitive Data types in Java
Java has 8 primitive types of data:
1: Boolean(boolean) Size: N/A, Min Val: N/A, Max Value: N/A
2: Character(char) Size: 16-bit
3: Byte Integer(byte) Size: 8-bit
4: Short Integer(short) Size: 16-bit
5: Integer(int) Size: 32-bit
6: Long Integer(long) Size: 64-bit
7: Floating-point(float) Size: 32-bit
8: Double precision floating-point(double) Size: 64-bit

byte, short, int, and long are whole value signed numbers
float and double are fractional precision numbers
char represents symbols in a character set, while
boolean represents true/false values

  Unsigned numbers can hold a larger positive value, 
  and no negative value

  Unsigned uses the leading bit, while signed uses the 
  leftmost bit to identify if a number is + || _
  signed integer can hold both + && - values

Jave integers(byte, short, int, long) are signed
and can have positive and negative values

ranges:
byte: -128 to 127
short: -32,768 to 32,767
int: -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
long: -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807

There are two kinds of floating-point types: float & double
float represents single-precision numbers, while double stores
double precision numbers
double 64 bit width
float 32 bit width

The word double derives from the fact that a 
double-precision number uses twice as many bits 
as a regular floating-point number.  For example, 
if a single-precision number requires 32 bits, 
its double-precision counterpart will be 64 bits long.

The extra bits increase not only the precision but 
also the range of magnitudes that can be represented.
